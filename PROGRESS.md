# Literature Game - Development Progress

## 📋 Project Overview
Building a real-time multiplayer Literature card game with:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Express + Socket.io + TypeScript  
- **Shared Logic**: TypeScript game engine and type definitions
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with client/server/shared packages

---

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### **Phase 0.1 – Initialize Monorepo** ✅
**Goal**: Set up workspace structure and package management

**What was built:**
- Root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- Three main folders: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`
- NPM workspace setup for managing multiple packages

**Files created:**
- `package.json` (root workspace config)
- Folder structure: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`

**Key learnings:**
- Monorepos allow multiple related projects in one repository
- Workspaces enable shared dependencies and code reuse
- PowerShell syntax differs from bash for creating directories

---

### **Phase 0.2 – Setup TypeScript in all packages** ✅
**Goal**: Configure TypeScript compilation across all workspaces

**What was built:**
- TypeScript configuration for each package
- Workspace references for code sharing
- Development dependencies and build scripts

**Files created:**
- `tsconfig.json` (root TypeScript project references)
- `shared/tsconfig.json` (CommonJS output, declaration files)
- `server/tsconfig.json` (CommonJS for Node.js, references shared)
- `client/tsconfig.json` (ESNext for React, references shared)
- `shared/package.json`, `server/package.json`, `client/package.json`

**Key learnings:**
- TypeScript provides type safety across client/server boundaries
- Project references enable workspace dependencies
- CommonJS vs ESNext module formats matter for different environments
- Declaration files (`.d.ts`) provide IntelliSense for consumers

---

### **Phase 0.3 – Setup shared module alias** ✅
**Goal**: Create shared type definitions for game data structures

**What was built:**
- Core game interfaces and types
- Shared data structures used by both client and server
- Type-safe game logic foundations

**Files created:**
- `shared/src/types.ts` - Core interfaces:
  - `Card` interface (suit, rank)
  - `Player` interface (id, name, team, hand, cardCount)
  - `GameState` interface (players, currentPlayer, phase, claimedSets, lastMove)
  - `AskCardMove` and `ClaimMove` interfaces
  - `Suit` and `Rank` type unions
- `shared/src/index.ts` - Main export file

**Key learnings:**
- Interfaces define contracts for data structures
- Type unions restrict values to specific options
- Shared types prevent client/server data mismatches
- Optional properties (`?`) handle conditional data

---

### **Phase 1.1 – Implement createDeck()** ✅
**Goal**: Create Literature-specific 48-card deck (no 8s)

**What was built:**
- Function that generates a complete Literature deck
- Type-safe card creation using shared interfaces
- Comprehensive test suite

**Files created:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts` - Core game logic:
  - `createDeck()`: Creates 48-card deck (4 suits × 12 ranks, excluding 8s)
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts` - Test functions:
  - `testCreateDeck()`: Verifies deck has 48 cards, 4 suits, 12 per suit, no duplicates

**Key learnings:**
- Literature uses 48 cards (standard deck minus four 8s)
- TypeScript's type system prevents invalid card creation
- Nested loops generate all suit/rank combinations
- Pure functions have no side effects

**Test results:**
- ✅ Deck has exactly 48 cards
- ✅ Contains 4 suits with 12 cards each
- ✅ All cards are unique
- ✅ TypeScript prevents creating cards with rank '8'

---

### **Phase 1.2 – Implement shuffleDeck()** ✅
**Goal**: Randomize deck order using proven algorithm

**What was built:**
- Fisher-Yates shuffle implementation
- In-place array modification for efficiency
- Randomness testing and validation

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `shuffleDeck(deck)`: Implements Fisher-Yates algorithm
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testShuffleDeck()`: Verifies shuffle preserves cards but changes order

**Algorithm details:**
- **Fisher-Yates shuffle**: Mathematically proven fair randomization
- **In-place modification**: Changes original array (memory efficient)
- **Swap technique**: Uses array destructuring `[a, b] = [b, a]`

**Test results:**
- ✅ Returns same deck object (in-place modification)
- ✅ Preserves all 48 cards after shuffle
- ✅ Contains same cards in different order
- ✅ Multiple shuffles produce different arrangements
- ✅ No cards lost or duplicated

**Key learnings:**
- Fisher-Yates is the gold standard for array shuffling
- `Math.random()` provides sufficient randomness for games
- In-place algorithms are more memory efficient
- Testing randomness requires statistical approaches

## 🧠 Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Monorepo Architecture**: Enables code sharing while maintaining separation
2. **TypeScript Throughout**: Provides type safety and better developer experience  
3. **Shared Package**: Prevents client/server data structure mismatches
4. **CommonJS for Node**: Ensures compatibility with Node.js backend
5. **Fisher-Yates Shuffle**: Uses mathematically proven fair randomization
6. **Pure Functions**: Game logic functions have no side effects
