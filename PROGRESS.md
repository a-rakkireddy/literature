- **Shared Logic**: TypeScript game engine and type definitions
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with client/server/shared packages

---

## ✅ COMPLETED PHASES

### **Phase 0.1 – Initialize Monorepo** ✅
**Goal**: Set up workspace structure and package management

**What was built:**
- Root `package.json` with workspace configuration
- Three main folders: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`
- NPM workspace setup for managing multiple packages

**Files created:**
- `package.json` (root workspace config)
- Folder structure: `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`

**Key learnings:**
- Monorepos allow multiple related projects in one repository
- Workspaces enable shared dependencies and code reuse
- PowerShell syntax differs from bash for creating directories

---

### **Phase 0.2 – Setup TypeScript in all packages** ✅
**Goal**: Configure TypeScript compilation across all workspaces

**What was built:**
- TypeScript configuration for each package
- Workspace references for code sharing
- Development dependencies and build scripts

**Files created:**
- `tsconfig.json` (root TypeScript project references)
- `shared/tsconfig.json` (CommonJS output, declaration files)
- `server/tsconfig.json` (CommonJS for Node.js, references shared)
- `client/tsconfig.json` (ESNext for React, references shared)
- `shared/package.json`, `server/package.json`, `client/package.json`

**Key learnings:**
- TypeScript provides type safety across client/server boundaries
- Project references enable workspace dependencies
- CommonJS vs ESNext module formats matter for different environments
- Declaration files (`.d.ts`) provide IntelliSense for consumers

---

### **Phase 0.3 – Setup shared module alias** ✅
**Goal**: Create shared type definitions for game data structures

**What was built:**
- Core game interfaces and types
- Shared data structures used by both client and server
- Type-safe game logic foundations

**Files created:**
- `shared/src/types.ts` - Core interfaces:
  - `Card` interface (suit, rank)
  - `Player` interface (id, name, team, hand, cardCount)
  - `GameState` interface (players, currentPlayer, phase, claimedSets, lastMove)
  - `AskCardMove` and `ClaimMove` interfaces
  - `Suit` and `Rank` type unions
- `shared/src/index.ts` - Main export file

**Key learnings:**
- Interfaces define contracts for data structures
- Type unions restrict values to specific options
- Shared types prevent client/server data mismatches
- Optional properties (`?`) handle conditional data

---

### **Phase 1.1 – Implement createDeck()** ✅
**Goal**: Create Literature-specific 48-card deck (no 8s)

**What was built:**
- Function that generates a complete Literature deck
- Type-safe card creation using shared interfaces
- Comprehensive test suite

**Files created:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts` - Core game logic:
  - `createDeck()`: Creates 48-card deck (4 suits × 12 ranks, excluding 8s)
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts` - Test functions:
  - `testCreateDeck()`: Verifies deck has 48 cards, 4 suits, 12 per suit, no duplicates

**Key learnings:**
- Literature uses 48 cards (standard deck minus four 8s)
- TypeScript's type system prevents invalid card creation
- Nested loops generate all suit/rank combinations
- Pure functions have no side effects

**Test results:**
- ✅ Deck has exactly 48 cards
- ✅ Contains 4 suits with 12 cards each
- ✅ All cards are unique
- ✅ TypeScript prevents creating cards with rank '8'

---

### **Phase 1.2 – Implement shuffleDeck()** ✅
**Goal**: Randomize deck order using proven algorithm

**What was built:**
- Fisher-Yates shuffle implementation
- In-place array modification for efficiency
- Randomness testing and validation

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `shuffleDeck(deck)`: Implements Fisher-Yates algorithm
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testShuffleDeck()`: Verifies shuffle preserves cards but changes order

**Algorithm details:**
- **Fisher-Yates shuffle**: Mathematically proven fair randomization
- **In-place modification**: Changes original array (memory efficient)
- **Swap technique**: Uses array destructuring `[a, b] = [b, a]`

**Test results:**
- ✅ Returns same deck object (in-place modification)
- ✅ Preserves all 48 cards after shuffle
- ✅ Contains same cards in different order
- ✅ Multiple shuffles produce different arrangements
- ✅ No cards lost or duplicated

**Key learnings:**
- Fisher-Yates is the gold standard for array shuffling
- `Math.random()` provides sufficient randomness for games
- In-place algorithms are more memory efficient
- Testing randomness requires statistical approaches

### **Phase 1.3 – Implement `initializeGame(players)` function** ✅
**Goal**: Create complete game state from player list with proper card dealing and team assignment

**What was built:**
- Game initialization function supporting both 6 and 8 player variants
- Fair card dealing simulation (one card at a time, round-robin)
- Automatic team assignment with perfect balance
- Complete GameState object creation

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `initializeGame(playerNames)`: Creates complete game state
  - `generateGameId()`: Helper function for unique game IDs
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testInitializeGame()`: Comprehensive test suite
  - `testGameSetup()`: Helper function testing both game variants

**Game variants supported:**
- **6 players**: 2 teams of 3, 8 cards each (48 ÷ 6 = 8)
- **8 players**: 2 teams of 4, 6 cards each (48 ÷ 8 = 6)

**Team assignment logic:**
- Players alternate teams by index: 0,1,0,1,0,1,... 
- Ensures equal team sizes and proper Literature seating

**Test results:**
- ✅ Supports both 6-player and 8-player games
- ✅ Correct card distribution for each variant
- ✅ Balanced teams (3v3 or 4v4)
- ✅ All 48 cards distributed with no duplicates
- ✅ Random starting player selection
- ✅ Proper game state initialization
- ✅ Error handling for invalid player counts
- ✅ Player ID generation from names

**Key learnings:**
- Literature has two official variants (6 or 8 players)
- Card dealing should simulate real-world round-robin dealing
- Team balance is crucial for fair gameplay
- Dynamic calculations allow flexible player counts
- Comprehensive testing catches edge cases

---

### **Phase 1.4** – Implement `validateMove(gameState, move)` ✅
**Goal**: Validate ask-card moves according to Literature game rules

**What was built:**
- Complete move validation system for ask-card moves
- Rule enforcement according to official Literature rules
- Comprehensive error checking and edge case handling
- Half-suit validation logic

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `validateMove(gameState, move)`: Main validation function for all move types
  - `validateAskCardMove(gameState, move)`: Specific validation for ask-card moves
  - `isHighCard(rank)`: Helper function to determine high vs low half-suits
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testValidateMove()`: Comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases
  - `createTestGameState()`: Helper function for controlled test scenarios

**Literature rules implemented:**
1. **Game phase**: Move only allowed during 'playing' phase
2. **Turn validation**: Only current player can make moves
3. **Team restriction**: Can't ask teammates for cards
4. **Card availability**: Target player must have at least one card
5. **Card ownership**: Can't ask for cards you already possess
6. **Half-suit requirement**: Must have a card in the same half-suit to ask
7. **Half-suit matching**: Can only ask for cards in the same half (high/low) you possess

**Half-suit logic:**
- **Low half-suits**: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- **High half-suits**: 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
- Players can only ask for cards in the same half-suit they possess

**Test results:**
- ✅ Accepts valid ask-card moves
- ✅ Rejects moves when game not in playing phase
- ✅ Rejects moves when not player's turn
- ✅ Rejects asking teammates for cards
- ✅ Rejects asking players with no cards
- ✅ Rejects asking for cards you already have
- ✅ Rejects asking without having same half-suit
- ✅ Rejects asking for wrong half-suit (high vs low)
- ✅ Rejects moves with nonexistent target players
- ✅ Properly rejects claim moves (not yet implemented)

**Key learnings:**
- Literature's half-suit system is fundamental to gameplay
- Rule validation must be comprehensive to prevent cheating
- Type-safe move validation catches errors at compile time
- Edge cases require careful testing and handling

---

### **Phase 1.5** – Implement `applyMove(gameState, move)` ✅
**Goal**: Execute validated moves and update game state with proper card transfers and turn logic

**What was built:**
- Complete move execution system for ask-card moves
- Immutable state updates that don't modify original game state
- Proper card transfer mechanics between players
- Turn management based on move success/failure
- Move history tracking in `lastMove`

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `applyMove(gameState, move)`: Main move execution function for all move types
  - `applyAskCardMove(gameState, move)`: Specific execution for ask-card moves
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testApplyMove()`: Comprehensive test suite with 6 test scenarios

**Move execution logic:**
1. **State immutability**: Creates deep copy of game state to avoid mutations
2. **Card lookup**: Searches target player's hand for requested card
3. **Successful transfer**: If card found, transfers from target to asking player
4. **Failed transfer**: If card not found, no transfer occurs
5. **Turn management**: 
   - Success: Asking player keeps turn (can ask again)
   - Failure: Turn passes to target player
6. **History tracking**: Records move details in `lastMove`

**Card transfer mechanics:**
- **Remove from target**: Uses `splice()` to remove card from target's hand & decrements `cardCount`
- **Add to asking player**: Uses `push()` to add card to asking player's hand & increments `cardCount`
- **Exact card matching**: Matches both suit and rank precisely
- **Maintains hand integrity**: All cards remain in the game, just change owners

**Turn logic implemented:**
- **Successful ask**: Current player keeps turn (Literature rule - continue asking when successful)
- **Failed ask**: Turn passes to target player (Literature rule - failed asker loses turn)
- **Multiple asks**: Player can chain successful asks until they fail

**Test results:**
- ✅ Successful card transfers work correctly
- ✅ Failed asks pass turn to target player
- ✅ Card counts update accurately
- ✅ Original game state remains unchanged (immutability)
- ✅ Multiple successful asks work in sequence
- ✅ Move history recorded correctly in `lastMove`
- ✅ Claim moves properly rejected (not yet implemented)

**Key learnings:**
- Immutable updates prevent unexpected side effects
- Deep copying preserves original state for debugging/undo
- Turn logic is critical for maintaining game flow
- Card counting must stay synchronized with actual cards
- Move history enables features like "what was the last question?"

### **Phase 1.6** – Implement `checkClaim(gameState, claim)` ✅
**Goal**: Complete half-suit claiming system with all Literature rules and edge cases

**What was built:**
- Complete claiming system for half-suit validation and scoring
- All three Literature claiming scenarios implemented
- Comprehensive claim validation with detailed error messages  
- Automatic game state updates for successful/failed/cancelled claims
- Integration with existing validateMove and applyMove functions

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `checkClaim(gameState, claim)`: Main claiming function with result object
  - `validateClaimMove(gameState, move)`: Basic claim validation for validateMove
  - `getHalfSuitCards(suit, isHigh)`: Helper to generate expected cards
  - `findOpponentCards()`: Helper to check if opponents have cards
  - `verifyTeamPossession()`: Helper to verify team has all cards  
  - `verifyCardLocations()`: Helper to check stated locations are correct
  - `awardHalfSuit()`: Helper to award half-suit to winning team
  - `cancelHalfSuit()`: Helper to cancel half-suit (remove cards, no winner)
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testCheckClaim()`: Comprehensive test suite with 6 claim scenarios
  - `createClaimTestGameState()`: Helper for controlled claim testing
  - Updated `testValidateMove()` and `testApplyMove()` for claim support

**Literature claiming rules implemented:**
1. **Perfect Claim** ✅: Team has all 6 cards with correct locations → Team wins half-suit
2. **Wrong Locations** ❌: Team has cards but locations incorrect → Half-suit cancelled 
3. **Opponent Interference** 🔄: Opposing team has any cards → Opposing team wins half-suit
4. **Invalid Structure**: Wrong card count, wrong cards, etc. → Claim rejected

**Claim validation checks:**
- **Basic structure**: Must specify card locations
- **Card count**: Exactly 6 cards required for half-suit
- **Card validity**: Cards must match the specified half-suit (high vs low)
- **Player existence**: All specified players must exist in game
- **Turn validation**: Must be claiming player's turn
- **Duplicate prevention**: Can't claim already claimed half-suits

**State management:**
- **Card removal**: Successfully claimed/cancelled cards removed from all players
- **Score tracking**: Winning team recorded in `claimedSets`
- **Card count sync**: Player `cardCount` automatically updated
- **Immutable updates**: Original game state preserved

**Claiming scenarios tested:**
- ✅ Perfect claim with correct locations succeeds
- ✅ Wrong locations cancel half-suit (nobody wins)
- ✅ Opponent cards award to opposing team
- ✅ Wrong card count rejected with clear message
- ✅ Invalid cards for half-suit rejected  
- ✅ Already claimed half-suits blocked in validation
- ✅ Integration with validateMove and applyMove works

**Return value structure:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;           // True if claim succeeded
  winningTeam: number | null; // Team that won (null if cancelled)
  updatedState: GameState;    // New game state after claim
  message: string;           // Descriptive result message
}
```

**Key learnings:**
- Claiming is the most complex game mechanic in Literature
- Three distinct outcomes require careful state management
- Location verification is critical for fair gameplay
- Opponent interference creates strategic tension
- Clear error messages help players understand failures

### **Phase 1.7** – Implement Game Ending Logic ✅
**Goal**: Complete game termination system with score calculation and winner determination

**What was built:**
- Complete game ending detection system
- Final score calculation and winner determination
- Support for all ending scenarios (wins, ties, cancelled sets)
- Automatic game phase transition to 'finished'
- Comprehensive result reporting system

**Files updated:**
- `shared/src/game-engine.ts`:
  - `isGameOver(gameState)`: Checks if all 8 half-suits are claimed/cancelled
  - `endGame(gameState)`: Finalizes game state and sets phase to 'finished'
  - `getGameResults(gameState)`: Comprehensive result calculation and winner determination
  - `processClaimWithGameEnd(gameState, claim)`: Convenience function that processes claims and auto-ends game
- `shared/src/game-engine.test.ts`:
  - `testGameEnding()`: Comprehensive test suite with 5+ ending scenarios

**Game ending logic:**
1. **End condition**: Game ends when all 8 half-suits are accounted for (4 suits × 2 halves = 8 total)
2. **Score calculation**: Count half-suits won by each team (excluding cancelled sets)
3. **Winner determination**: Team with most half-suits wins
4. **Tie handling**: Games can end in ties when teams have equal scores
5. **State finalization**: Game phase set to 'finished' when complete

**Literature ending rules implemented:**
- **All sets claimed**: Game ends when `claimedSets.length === 8`
- **Score counting**: Only successful claims count toward team scores (`team !== null`)
- **Winner logic**: Team with most half-suits wins; ties are possible
- **Cancelled sets**: Don't count toward any team's score but still end the game

**Result reporting system:**
```typescript
{
  isGameOver: boolean;        // True when all 8 half-suits processed
  team0Score: number;         // Half-suits won by team 0
  team1Score: number;         // Half-suits won by team 1
  cancelledSets: number;      // Half-suits cancelled due to wrong locations
  winner: number | null;      // Winning team (null for ties)
  message: string;           // Human-readable result description
  totalSets: number;         // Total half-suits processed (should be 8)
}
```

**Ending scenarios tested:**
- ✅ New games correctly identified as not over (0/8 sets)
- ✅ Games in progress correctly identified as ongoing (4/8 sets)
- ✅ Team 0 wins scenario (5-3 score)
- ✅ Team 1 wins scenario (3-5 score)
- ✅ Tied games (4-4 score)
- ✅ Games with cancelled sets (3-2 with 3 cancelled)
- ✅ Automatic game ending on final claim
- ✅ Phase transition to 'finished'
- ✅ Error handling for premature ending attempts

**Integration features:**
- **Auto-ending**: `processClaimWithGameEnd()` automatically ends game after final claim
- **State preservation**: All game history preserved in final state
- **Helper functions**: `getClaimedSets()`, `getCancelledSets()` for analysis
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support for all ending functions

**Key learnings:**
- Literature games have exactly 8 half-suits that determine the end condition
- Cancelled sets still count toward game completion but not team scores
- Ties are common and valid outcomes in Literature
- Automatic game ending improves user experience
- Clear result messaging helps players understand outcomes
